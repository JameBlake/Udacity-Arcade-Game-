## Instructions

### What is the Classic Arcade Game Clone?

The Classic Arcade Game Clone is a game where you have to save the girl. Just like Mario would!

### It sounds great! How does one play?

_It's simple!_

Unzip the folder that has be provided to you by the creator of this game (i.e. James B) and open up the index.html file with your browser. Your quest now begins.

Simply navigate your character from the bottom of the map to the water at the top using your directional keys on your keyboard.

**Sounds easy? Don't be fooled!**

The evil ladybirds are out to stop you and if they touch you, you will lose a life.
Losing a life will result in you being returned back to the starting position.
If you lose all your lives, the game will end.

If you manage to reach the water, you will be rewarded with the satsifaction of rescuing your character.

Upon completion of the game, either successfully or not, a play again button will be available to enjoy the game yet again.

Can you rescue the girl using fewer lives?

That is your challenge if you choose to accept it.
